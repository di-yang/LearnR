This is an [R Markdown](http://rmarkdown.rstudio.com) Notebook. When you execute code within the notebook, the results appear beneath the code. 

Try executing this chunk by clicking the *Run* button within the chunk or by placing your cursor inside it and pressing *Cmd+Shift+Enter*. 

```{r}
library(ISLR2)
names(Smarket)
dim(Smarket)
summary(Smarket)
pairs(Smarket)
cor(Smarket[,-9])
attach(Smarket)
plot(Volume)
```
```{r}
glm.fits <- glm(Direction ~ Lag1 + Lag2 + Lag3+ Lag4 +Lag5 + Volume ,data = Smarket , family= binomial)
summary(glm.fits)
coef(glm.fits)
summary(glm.fits)$coef
summary(glm.fits)$coef[, 4]
glm.probs = predict(glm.fits , type ="response")
glm.probs [1:10]
contrasts (Direction)
glm.pred <- rep("Down", 1250)
glm.pred[glm.probs> .5] = "Up"
```

Add a new chunk by clicking the *Insert Chunk* button on the toolbar or by pressing *Cmd+Option+I*.

When you save the notebook, an HTML file containing the code and output will be saved alongside it (click the *Preview* button or press *Cmd+Shift+K* to preview the HTML file). 

The preview shows you a rendered HTML copy of the contents of the editor. Consequently, unlike *Knit*, *Preview* does not run any R code chunks. Instead, the output of the chunk when it was last run in the editor is displayed.
