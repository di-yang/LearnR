This is an [R Markdown](http://rmarkdown.rstudio.com) Notebook. When you execute code within the notebook, the results appear beneath the code. 

Try executing this chunk by clicking the *Run* button within the chunk or by placing your cursor inside it and pressing *Cmd+Shift+Enter*. 

```{r}
library(splines)
library(ISLR2)
attach(Wage)
fit = lm(wage ~ poly(age, 4), data=Wage)
coef(summary(fit))
fit2 = lm(wage ~ poly(age, 4, raw=T), data=Wage)
coef(summary(fit2))
fit2a = lm(wage ~ age + I(age ^2) + I(age ^3) + I(age ^4) , data = Wage)
coef(fit2a)
agelims = range(age)
age.grid = seq(from = agelims [1], to = agelims [2])
preds = predict(fit , newdata= list(age= age.grid),se= TRUE)
se.bands = cbind(preds$fit + 2 * preds$se.fit , preds$fit - 2* preds$se.fit)



fit= lm(wage ~ bs(age, knots = c(25,40,60)), data = Wage)
pred = predict(fit , newdata = list(age = age.grid), se= T)
```

Add a new chunk by clicking the *Insert Chunk* button on the toolbar or by pressing *Cmd+Option+I*.

When you save the notebook, an HTML file containing the code and output will be saved alongside it (click the *Preview* button or press *Cmd+Shift+K* to preview the HTML file). 

The preview shows you a rendered HTML copy of the contents of the editor. Consequently, unlike *Knit*, *Preview* does not run any R code chunks. Instead, the output of the chunk when it was last run in the editor is displayed.
